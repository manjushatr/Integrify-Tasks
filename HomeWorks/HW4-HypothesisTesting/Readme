1. Suppose we want to test whether the mean weight of apples in a grocery store is 150
grams. We randomly sample 20 apples from the store and measure their weights,
getting the following data:
Apple_weights = [145, 155, 160, 146, 142, 152, 150, 147, 148, 149, 148, 152,
153, 155, 154, 148, 151, 147, 153, 146]
○ What test should we use and why?
○ State the null and alternative hypotheses.
○ Choose a significance level (α) (the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis
when it is actually true).
○ Determine the degrees of freedom (df) of the sample. Df = sample size -1
○ Determine the critical value of t based on the significance level and degrees of
freedom. For a two-tailed test with α = 0.05 and df = 19, the critical values are
-2.093 and 2.093.
○ Compare and interpret the results of the test to the critical value
2. Suppose we want to test whether the mean height of all men in a population is 180 cm
assuming that the population standard deviation = 2. We randomly sample 50 men from
the population and measure their heights, getting the following data:
Men_height = [177, 180, 182, 179, 178, 181, 176, 183, 179, 180, 178, 181, 177,
178, 180, 179, 182, 180, 183, 181, 179, 177, 180, 181, 178, 180, 182, 179, 177,
182, 178, 181, 183, 179, 180, 181, 183, 178, 177, 181, 179, 182, 180, 181, 178,
180, 179, 181, 183, 179]

3. Suppose we want to test whether the mean weight of a population of cats is different
from 4 kg. We randomly sample 50 cats from the population and measure their weights,
getting the following data:
Cats_weights = [3.9, 4.2, 4.5, 4.1, 4.3, 3.8, 4.6, 4.2, 3.7, 4.3, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1, 4.5,
4.2, 3.8, 3.9, 4.3, 4.1, 4.0, 4.4, 4.2, 4.1, 4.6, 4.4, 4.2, 4.1, 4.3, 4.0, 4.4, 4.3, 3.8,
4.1, 4.5, 4.2, 4.3, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 3.9, 4.3, 3.7, 4.1, 4.5, 4.2, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 4.1, 4.5]
○ Perform one sample two tailed Z-Test to determine whether the mean weight of
the sampled cats is significantly different from 4 kg.
○ State the null and alternative hypotheses.
○ Choose a significance level (α) (the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis
when it is actually true).
○ Calculate the z-score using the formula:
○ Assuming that the standard deviation is equal to the sample mean
○ Look up the critical z-value at the chosen significance level (α) using a z-table.
○ Compare the calculated z-score to the critical z-values. If the calculated z-score
falls outside the range between the critical z-values, we reject the null hypothesis
in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
