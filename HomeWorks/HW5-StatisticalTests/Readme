bandwidth 4.5 GHz from the previous model with a standard deviation of 0.6
GHz, using a significance level of 0.05.

2. T-test
A. One sample T-test: Suppose we have a new manufacturing process for
producing aluminum cans, and we want to test whether the mean weight of the
cans produced using this new process is significantly different from the target
weight of 15 grams. We randomly sample 30 cans produced using the new
process and measure their weights in grams. We obtain the following data:
Sample = [14.8, 15.2, 15.1, 15.3, 15.0, 14.9, 15.2, 14.8, 15.1, 15.0, 14.9,

15.3, 15.1, 15.0, 14.8, 15.2, 15.0]
● State the null and alternative hypotheses.
● Use the appropriate T-test to determine whether the mean weight of the
produced cans is equal to the target weight of 15 grams, using a
significance level of 0.05.
● Interpret the results
B. Two Sample T-test: Suppose a food company has developed a new flavor of
potato chips and wants to compare it to the current best-selling flavor. The
company randomly selects two groups of 20 customers each. The first group is
given the new flavor of potato chips, while the second group is given the
best-selling flavor. After trying the potato chips, each customer rates the flavor on
a scale of 1 to 10. The following are the flavor ratings for the two groups:
New flavor = [8, 7, 9, 6, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 7, 6, 8, 7, 9, 8, 7, 6, 9, 8, 7]
Best selling flavor = [6, 7, 8, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 8, 7, 6, 7, 6, 8, 7, 6, 7, 8, 6, 7]
● State the null and alternative hypotheses.
● Use the appropriate T-test to determine whether there is a significant
difference between the two groups or not, using a significance level of
0.05.
● Interpret the results
C. Paired T-test: Suppose a company wants to evaluate a new training program for
its employees. The company selects 20 employees and measures their
productivity before and after the training program. The following are the
productivity scores (number of tasks completed per hour) for each employee
before and after the training:
Before = [15, 18, 12, 10, 17, 16, 12, 14, 19, 18, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 14, 16,
13, 15, 12]

● Use the appropriate T-test to determine whether the new training program
has had an effect on employee productivity, with a significance level of
0.05.
3. ANOVA Test
A. One-Way: Suppose a company has three departments (A, B, and C) and wants
to test whether there is a significant difference in salaries between the
departments. The company selects 10 employees randomly from each
department and records their salaries.
Department A = [55, 60, 50, 58, 63, 62, 57, 56, 61, 59]
Department B = [50, 52, 48, 49, 55, 53, 51, 54, 47, 50]
Department C = [45, 43, 48, 50, 42, 47, 49, 46, 44, 48]
● State the null and alternative hypotheses.
● Use One-Way ANOVA-test to determine whether there is a significant
difference in salaries between the three departments.
● Interpret the results
B. Two-Way: Suppose a company has three departments (A, B, and C) and wants
to test whether there is a significant difference in salaries between the
departments, while also considering the effect of gender. The company selects
10 employees randomly from each department and records their salaries and
gender.
Department A:
Male: [$55k, $60k, $50k, $58k, $63k]
Female: [$62k, $57k, $56k, $61k, $59k]
Department B:
Male: [$50k, $52k, $48k, $49k, $55k]
Female: [$53k, $51k, $54k, $47k, $50k]
Department C:
Male: [$45k, $43k, $48k, $50k, $42k]
Female: $47k, $49k, $46k, $44k, $48k]
● State the null and alternative hypotheses.
● Use Two-Way ANOVA-test to determine whether there is a significant
difference in salaries between the three departments.
● Interpret the results
4. Chi-Square: Suppose we have a hypothesis that a six-sided die is fair, with each side
having an equal probability of landing face up. We roll the die 100 times and record the
number of times each side appears:
Side Observed Frequency
1 18
2 20
3 16
4 22
5 14
6 10
Given that the expected probabilities are equal to 1/6, Use the class CHi-Square to
estimate the goodness-of-fit through chi-square test to determine whether the observed
frequencies are consistent with the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis of a
fair die.
5. A/B testing: Suppose a company has launched a new flavor of soda and wants to test if
it has a higher preference than the old flavor. The company conducts a survey with a
sample of 30 customers, randomly split into two groups of 15. One group is given the old
flavor of soda and the other group is given the new flavor of soda. Each participant rates
their preference on a scale of 1 to 10.
Old Flavor = [6, 7, 8, 5, 6, 7, 5, 8, 6, 7, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5]
New Flavor = [8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 6, 8]
● State the null and alternative hypotheses.
● Use two sample t-test to determine whether there is a significant
difference in preference between the old and new flavors of soda, with a
significance level of 0.05
