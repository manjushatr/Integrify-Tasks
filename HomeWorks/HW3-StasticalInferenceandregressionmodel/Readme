1.	Suppose we have a dataset that shows the number of bedrooms and the selling price for 20 houses in a particular neighborhood
Bedrooms = [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6]
Prices = 
[120,133,139,185,148,160,192,205,244,213,236,280,275,273,312,311,304,415,396,488]
2.	Using the Bedrooms data points:
○	Extract a random sample of size 10
○	Compute the mean and standard deviation of the sample
○	Compute the the mean of the population
○	Computer the confidence interval of 95% using the sample 
○	Check if the population mean lies between the upper and lower bounds of the interval

 

3.	Using both of the Bedrooms and the Prices:
○	Compute the covariance and the correlation between the two variables
○	Build a regression model and estimate the regression parameters (slope and intercept).
○	Predict the house price for a house with 7 rooms
○	Estimate the upper bound and the lower bounds of the prediction interval of a house with 7 rooms
■	Alpha = 0.1
■	N = 20
■	Df = N-2
 

4.	Using as sample of houses that have only 3 bedrooms 
5.	Try to find the lower price that can be payed for a house with 3 rooms using Tolerance interval
6.	Try  to find the highest price that can be payed for a house with 3 rooms using Tolerance interval

 
Some Extra stuff:
Try to use these Formulas as well and compare the results

We use the following formula to calculate a confidence interval:
ŷ0  +/-  tα/2,n-2 * Syx√((x0 – x̄)2/SSx + 1/n)
We use the following formula to calculate a prediction interval:
ŷ0  +/-  tα/2,n-2 * Syx√((x0 – x̄)2/SSx + 1/n + 1)
where:
●	ŷ0: Estimated mean value of response variable
●	tα/2,n-2: t-critical value with n-2 degrees of freedom
●	Syx: Standard error of response variable
●	x0: specific value of predictor variable 
●	x̄: mean value of predictor variable
●	SSx: Sum of squares for predictor variable
●	n: Total sample size
