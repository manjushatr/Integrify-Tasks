Data Exploration
1. Suppose we want to measure the water flow using three sensors (S1, S2, S3) fixed in
different places. Overalls we made 5 configurations where the data are recorded in
‘First set of data.xslsx’:
○ Explore the dataset in terms of:
■ Types of variables (categorical or numerical)
■ Statistics (min, mean, max, and std)
■ Errors (if any)
■ Outliers (BE CAREFUL)
■ Are there any errors included in the outlier set?
Data Labeling
2. Suppose we have a twitter dataset we want to label it into two classes Radical or
No-Radical the data are available in the repository Twitter Datasets.
